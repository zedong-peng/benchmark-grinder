name: benchmark-grinder
description: Run autonomous benchmark-improvement loops for projects that need repeated score optimization, including LLM, CV, retrieval, systems, and other measurable experiments. Use when the user wants Codex to establish a baseline, verify setup and benchmark assets, modify only approved files, run experiments, log every result, keep project docs updated, and continue iterating until explicitly stopped.

# Benchmark Grinder

Use this skill when the task is an ongoing benchmark-improvement loop rather than a one-off code change.

This skill is domain-agnostic. It applies to LLM, CV, retrieval, ranking, systems, inference, and other workloads that have:

- a benchmark or evaluation command
- a primary metric
- a bounded edit surface
- a reproducible run path

## Auto-discovery mode

When the user says "optimize [benchmark name]" or "grind [metric]" without providing a contract, automatically discover the project structure:

1. **Find evaluation scripts**: Search for files matching `eval*.py`, `test*.py`, `benchmark*.py`, `run*.sh`, or similar patterns
2. **Identify the metric**: Look in README, docs, or eval scripts for metric names (accuracy, loss, throughput, latency, mAP, etc.)
3. **Infer editable scope**: Typically includes model code, training scripts, config files, prompts, kernels - NOT eval harnesses or test data
4. **Infer frozen scope**: Evaluation scripts, test datasets, gold labels, correctness checks, benchmark harnesses
5. **Find the run command**: Check README, Makefile, package.json scripts, or common patterns like `python eval.py`, `pytest`, `make bench`
6. **Create benchmark.md**: Document your findings so the user can verify before the first run

Common patterns by domain:

**LLM projects:**
- Editable: `model/`, `train.py`, `prompts/`, `config.yaml`, inference code
- Frozen: `eval.py`, `test_data/`, `judge.py`, gold answers
- Metric: accuracy, win_rate, judge_score, perplexity
- Command: `python eval.py` or `pytest tests/`

**Kernel/systems projects:**
- Editable: `kernels/`, `*.cu`, `*.cpp`, launch configs, optimization flags
- Frozen: `test_correctness.py`, `benchmark_harness.py`, reference outputs
- Metric: throughput, latency, GFLOPS, memory_bandwidth
- Command: `python benchmark.py` or `make bench`

**CV projects:**
- Editable: `models/`, `train.py`, augmentation, architecture code
- Frozen: `eval.py`, test datasets, annotation files
- Metric: accuracy, mAP, IoU, FID
- Command: `python eval.py --split test`

After discovery, show the user your findings and ask for confirmation before the first baseline run.

## Required project facts

Before starting, confirm or infer:

- target metric and whether higher or lower is better
- canonical benchmark or training command
- resource budget such as time, GPU, memory, disk, or API spend
- editable scope
- frozen scope
- benchmark assets required locally
- result ledger path
- baseline rule

If any are missing and auto-discovery doesn't find them, read the repo and create a concrete project contract before experimentation.

## Project contract

Maintain or create a short operating contract such as `benchmark.md`.

It should record:

- benchmark name
- target metric and optimization direction
- canonical run command
- setup and download steps
- editable files
- forbidden changes
- timeout rule
- result logging format

If the repo already has an equivalent file like `program.md`, `RUNBOOK.md`, or `EXPERIMENTS.md`, reuse it instead of duplicating it.

## Setup workflow

1. Read the benchmark contract and in-scope files.
2. **Create a dedicated experiment branch**: Propose a branch name like `benchmark/<date>` or `benchmark/<metric>-<date>`. Create it with `git checkout -b <branch-name>`.
3. Verify datasets, weights, tokenizers, caches, fixtures, or other benchmark assets exist locally.
4. If assets are missing, fetch them using the project's documented path.
5. Initialize the result ledger if needed (e.g., `results.tsv` with header row).
6. Run the untouched baseline first unless the project is currently broken.

## Asset rules

When external assets are required:

- prefer the project's existing setup commands
- record exactly how assets were fetched
- do not modify evaluation data
- do not vendor heavy assets into git unless the repo already does
- verify presence before downloading again

Typical assets include:

- datasets
- pretrained weights
- tokenizers
- indexes
- compiled artifacts
- benchmark fixtures

## Baseline-first rule

The first completed run should usually be the current code as-is.

Use that run to:

- establish the current score
- validate the environment
- catch setup issues early
- define the keep or discard threshold

Only skip it if the current code cannot run at all.

## Edit policy

Only modify files inside the approved editable scope.

Never change:

- gold labels or evaluation answers
- scoring code unless benchmark maintenance is explicitly in scope
- hidden test fixtures
- unrelated infrastructure just to force a score

If a score can be improved by gaming the evaluator, treat that result as invalid.

## Core loop

Repeat until the user interrupts you or a hard stop condition is reached:

1. Check git state: current branch and commit
2. Choose one experimental idea with a clear hypothesis
3. Implement it within the approved scope
4. **Git commit the experiment** with a descriptive message
5. Run the benchmark and capture logs
6. Parse the primary metric and relevant secondary metrics
7. Append the outcome to the result ledger (do NOT commit the ledger file)
8. **If the result improved**: keep the commit and advance the branch
9. **If the result regressed or crashed**: `git reset --hard HEAD~1` to discard the commit
10. Start the next idea immediately

Do not stop after each run to ask whether to continue.

## Good experiment criteria

Prefer experiments that are:

- single-hypothesis
- cheap to evaluate
- easy to revert
- simple relative to expected gain
- aligned with the existing architecture

Common experiment classes:

- hyperparameters
- architecture
- data pipeline
- loss functions
- augmentation
- decoding or inference
- batching and throughput
- indexing and retrieval
- systems tuning

Avoid bundling many unrelated changes unless broad exploration is justified.

## Keep and discard

Use the primary metric first.

Keep when:

- the primary metric improves
- or the metric is effectively unchanged and the system becomes simpler, cheaper, or more stable

Discard when:

- the metric regresses
- complexity rises without meaningful gain
- memory, latency, or cost worsens without justification
- the result is noisy and unsupported

If noise is high, rerun selectively rather than overinterpreting tiny deltas.

## Logging

Every run should append to a machine-readable ledger such as `results.tsv` or `results.jsonl`.

**IMPORTANT**: Do NOT commit the results ledger to git. Keep it untracked so the git history stays clean with only code changes.

Recommended fields:

- commit (short hash, 7 chars)
- timestamp
- benchmark
- primary_metric
- secondary_metrics
- cost_or_memory
- status
- short_description
- log_path

Recommended statuses:

- `keep`
- `discard`
- `crash`
- `timeout`
- `invalid`

Preserve the existing project format if one already exists.

## Documentation upkeep

Keep the operating docs current while the loop runs.

At minimum, update:

- the result ledger after every run
- the benchmark contract when setup or rules change
- a progress note when a new best result appears or a failure pattern emerges

Useful files include:

- `benchmark.md`
- `results.tsv`
- `notes.md`
- `progress.md`
- per-run logs

Do not let the docs drift behind the experiments.

## Failure handling

Treat these outcomes explicitly:

- crash
- timeout
- OOM
- numerical instability
- bad checkpoint
- missing asset
- broken environment

When a run fails:

1. inspect the log
2. decide whether the issue is a narrow fix or a failed idea
3. log the failure
4. rerun only if the fix is local and justified

Do not loop on the same broken idea.

## Timeout discipline

Define both an expected runtime and a hard timeout.

If a run exceeds the hard timeout:

- terminate it
- mark it as `timeout`
- record enough context to avoid repeating the mistake

## Autonomy rule

This skill is designed for unattended benchmark work.

Once setup is complete and the loop has started:

- continue iterating without asking for permission after each run
- stop only for a real blocker, explicit user interruption, or a hard safety constraint
- leave enough logs and documentation for later inspection

If obvious ideas run out, read the code again, study prior failures, compare kept and discarded runs, and continue with the next best hypothesis.

## Domain adaptation

Adapt the metric and levers to the project.

The workflow stays stable even when the benchmark changes.
